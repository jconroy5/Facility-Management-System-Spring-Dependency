# FacilityManagementSystem
COMP 373/473 - Project 1 - Joseph Conroy and Nigel Castelino

# To run a client interface:
Select one of the client interfaces below to run by commenting out the other two.

EXAMPLE - To run MaintenanceClient, the main method would look like this:
//FacilityClient facilityClient = new FacilityClient();
//UsageClient usageClient = new UsageClient();
MaintenanceClient maintenanceClient = new MaintenanceClient();

Project 1: Facility Management System Design and Implementation
Project Description:
In this project, we will start providing an object domain model for Facility Management System by
addressing the design and implementation using OOP. The aim is to have a domain model that is
designed using OOP that will be used to study Object relationship and Dependency.

Based on the specification provided for a Facility Management System:

– Identify the main entitles of the problem domain.

– Identify their attributes.

– Identify their relationships.

– Identify their roles and responsibilities.

– Discover other objects that facilitate implementing responsibilities.

– Make available all client interfaces/services specified in the specification document
(Facility, Facility Use, and Facility Maintenance Client Interfaces).

Supporting documents:
- Requirement – Facility Management System Specification Document.
- Object Modeling
