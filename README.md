# Facility Management System with Spring Dependency
COMP 373/473 - Project 1 - Joseph Conroy and Nigel Castelino

# To run a client interface:
In ClientInterface.java (src/com/fms/client), select the client you want to run by commenting out the other two.

EXAMPLE - To run MaintenanceClient, the main method would look like this:
```
//FacilityClient facilityClient = new FacilityClient();
//UsageClient usageClient = new UsageClient();
MaintenanceClient maintenanceClient = new MaintenanceClient();
```

Project 2: Object Wiring Using Spring – A Facility Management System
Project Description:
In this project, we will change the object dependency and collaboration management from directly
instantiating to Dependency Injection container (Spring).:

- Domain Modeling and implementation

- Implementing Dependency Injection using Spring

You need to design and implement:

– Spring container configuration for Dependency Injection for the application that you
developed in Project 1.

– Using ApplicationContext Mechanism

– Dependency relationship using XML

Supporting documents:

- Class examples for Dependency Injection.

- Object Wiring Using Spring (http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.6/reference/beans.html)

Project Expectation:

- Group executed project

- Submission of Design, Configuration and Code

Project Submission and Grading:

- 10% of total grade

- Email the location of your solution for the implementation

Project Due Date:

- Submission of the Implementation - EOD 03/17/2019
